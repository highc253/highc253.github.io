				<h3>Mechanical Design Experience</h3>
				<p>I was lucky enough to maintain an in-person internship in the summer of 2020 at Viken Detection, a small company designing handheld security detection equipment in Burlington, MA.<br><br>Throughout the duration of my internship, I was working side by side with my mentor to design the enclosure for a new product whose internals had already been defined.<br><br>Below you will find a description of the experiences I gained and the things I learned, however due to my NDA I cannot show pictures of my final product here. Please contact me if interested as I can arrange for pictures to be shown if given lead time.</p>

		<p>During my time at Viken, I was prototyping daily with our SLA printer to create parts with proper fit and that could be manufactured additively. I was present for all calls with outside vendors and functioned as the point person for a few as we made DFM changes that would increase the success rate and therefore the production speed of my parts.<br><br>I was given subsections of the overall enclosure to develop on my own with the expectation that they fit with everything else that was being designed concurrently. Because of this I learned a lot about how to communicate technical details through conversational Mechanical Engineer language.<br><br>My internship also exposed me to an engineering release system for managing parts and their revisions. I'm now able to understand how parts flow from prototyping and tinkering to a released, ASME Y14.5 standard, drawing for quoting to vendors and then beyond to full production releases.</p>
