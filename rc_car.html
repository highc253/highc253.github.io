				<h3>Principles of Engineering Course Project</h3>
				<p>A robust, RC car built as a five member, interdisciplinary team over half a semester. Sparrow was designed to be driven off high places and stabilize through gyroscopic wheel action. As the chassis design and fabrication lead, I was responsible for the design of a shock tolerant final vehicle frame in the Solidworks CAD program and its fabrication in the Olin machine shop.</p>

In addition to this, the springs being used were in a U shape around the bottom of the axles. This proved to be ineffective once I received the spring steel I would be using and learned the steel would not easily buckle.</p>

In the final version, the main deck transitioned to a sheet metal plate that could easily be manufactured with a CNC plasma cutter. The leaf-springs transitioned into O's to utilize the spring steel's bending action rather than buckling as before.</p>

The system was powered with a LiPo battery and an additional moter in the center controlled the roll while the spinning of the wheels controlled pitch.</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;width: 80%;margin: 30% auto 0 auto;">The Sparrow was an opportunity for me to exercise the lessons I had learned in mechanical design and manufacturing in my first year of Olin. Determined to build this thing the "right way" the first time, I spent a great deal of time outside the machine shop ensuring that the design was perfect before fabrication began. Through this method I spent a lot less effort on large reworks later in the project and instead could focus on fine tuning the smaller parts that allowed the system to eventually perform effectively.</p>
