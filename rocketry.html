				<h3>Student Run Project Team</h3>
				<p>Started by 5 freshmen in the Fall of 2017, Olin Rocketry has since grown to a team of 21 engineers working to build Olin's first competition caliber high-powered rocket. As Project Manager, I was responsible for both the week to week planning and long term goals of the team. This included making schedules, formulating documentation strategies, creating document templates, contacting potential design reviewers, and reaching out to companies for financial support.<br><br>As a senior, I stepped down from the Project Manager position and now function as the System Engineer. I'm responsible for setting the technical requirements for each subsystem along with assisting in verification and validation activities. I also tend to the team's mass and power budgets.<br><br>The team was accepted into the 2020 Spaceport America Cup and planned to make our competition debut by launching our Phoenix III rocket to 10,000 feet. With the competition delayed due to COVID-19, we're still in active development to ensure a successful launch at the 2021 Cup.</p>
